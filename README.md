# Seafood Trade and Nutrient Flows in Pacific Island Countries

## Project Summary

<p>

  Aquatic food trade distributes essential dietary nutrients from fisheries to countries around the world. However, these international trade networks can be impacted by a range of environmental or socioeconomic factors, like changes in fisheries management, trade relations, industry financing, and more.   Health-wise, the region’s caloric needs are highly dependent on imports, unhealthy food imports are rising, and diet-related health ailments remain a challenge. Additionally, much of the global tuna supply is harvested from the productive Pacific Ocean waters surrounding these countries, but the nutrients from these fisheries tend to flow towards more nutrient-secure countries via trade and foreign fishing. Pacific Island countries may therefore occupy the role of “source” for seafood, while not receiving many social or health benefits. A thorough understanding of how seafood-derived nutrients move through international trade networks is therefore crucial for equitable progress towards desired development outcomes. Such disruptions can lower fisheries production and/or increase seafood imports, with potentially more severe negative impacts on already nutrient-insecure countries that are vulnerable to supply chain changes. In Oceania, several Pacific Island countries may be especially vulnerable to negative outcomes from fisheries supply chain changes.

  This study combines empirical data, network modeling, and statistical analysis to assess the roles of Pacific Island countries in distributing fisheries-derived nutrients globally, along with the ways that social-ecological factors may influence these nutrient flows. We leverage consumption data from the Aquatic Resources in Trade Database and nutrient data from the Aquatic Food Composition Database to analyze these topics. Specifically, we explore the net flows of fisheries-derived nutrients in and out of Pacific Island countries, the roles (i.e., source, exporter, or consumer) that countries occupy in these international networks, and the impacts of economic, fisheries, and oceanographic factors on these networks. Initial results indicate that Pacific Island countries have net outflows of fisheries-derived nutrients, often being sources and exporters of protein, vitamin B12, and fatty acids towards other countries. Domestic production and consumption comprises a substantial portion of the nutrients retained in the region, and fisheries and trade agreements may influence country-specific dynamics. Overall, this study may contribute to understanding the ways that globalized fisheries affect nutrient distributions worldwide.

  <strong>Figure.</strong> Production fate ratios (left) and consumption origin ratios (right) for all twelve Pacific Island countries (PICs). PICs are represented on each chart by columns on the x-axis, and the y-axis displays proportions for where each country’s fisheries production goes (production fate) and where consumed fisheries originate from (consumption origin). Proportions are calculated in units of species tonnes. For the production fate ratio chart, teal represents the proportion of each country’s catch that is ultimately exported for foreign consumption, while the orange represents the proportion that stays in the PIC for domestic consumption. The dotted line shows the average amount that is exported (≈ 65%). The consumption origin ratio chart displays in blue the proportion of fisheries consumed in PICs that are imported from foreign sources, and in yellow the proportion that was originally produced domestically in that same PIC. The dotted line shows the average share of consumption that is domestically produced (i.e., domestic consumption) at ≈ 73%.

## About the Author
Keiko Nomura is a marine social-ecological systems scientist focused on fisheries sustainability and marine resource management. Her ocean-centered research has covered topics like marine spatial planning, small-scale fisheries adaptation, and conflict and cooperation in international fisheries. She combines quantitative network and spatial analyses with qualitative governance contexts to address key questions on ocean resource use. As a Postdoctoral Researcher at ESIIL at CU Boulder, she is now exploring how social-ecological factors influence seafood trade in the Pacific and, in turn, how this supports food security and sustainable development in the region.
